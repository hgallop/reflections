What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository adds the hidden .git file that allows you to begin
to make commits based on the changes that you make to a file. You can then
commit new changes with a message, track those changes through commit ids and
compare new and old versions of your file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains files that have been created but may not have
been committed. The repository holds already committed files in sequence of when
each commit or change was saved or committed to the repository. However, the
staging area acts as an intermediary between the two. The staging area gives one
the opportunity to reflect on the most logical separation of the commits and
which combinations of file changes should be grouped together for the easiest
comparison between file changes.
